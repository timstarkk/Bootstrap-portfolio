                        My name is Tim Stark. I am from Baytown, Texas, a chemical plant/refinery town just east of
                        Houston.
                        As a kid, I always enjoyed drawing, and playing video games. When I was a kid, and someone asked
                        what I wanted to do when I got older,
                        I always told them I wanted to be a game designer. Not knowing what that entailed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        As I got older, I kept gaming, and that kept me interested in technology, (building my own PC,
                        etc.)
                        I also got into music, playing guitar and drums in high school
                        and after that I taught myself how to produce rap beats. I also began teaching myself how to
                        code. I
                        have some pretty big dreams for life, but have been sort of all over the place, not picking one
                        skill to master. As a lyft driver,
                        I fell into conversation with a developer for Indeed who encouraged me to pick one skill, and
                        dive
                        in head first.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        About two months ago, I found out my girlfriend is pregnant. (Her name is Sabryna, she is in the
                        picture with me above.)
                        When I heard the news, and thought about my next moves, the words of the Indeed developer came
                        to my
                        mind. In order to accelerate my career, and increase my finances in preparation for my first
                        child,
                        I have enrolled in this boot camp so that I can secure a job as a developer.
